/*
Develop a program in C++ to create a database of studentâ€™s 
information system containing the following information: 
Name, Roll number, Class, Division, Date of Birth, Blood group, 
Contact address, Telephone number, Driving license no. and other. 
Construct the database with suitable member functions. 
Make use of constructor, default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, 
static member functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory 
allocation operators-new and delete as well as exception handling.
