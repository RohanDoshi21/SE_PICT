/*
Write program to implement a priority queue in C++ using an inorder list to store the 
items in the queue. Create a class that includes the data items (which should be 
template) and the priority (which should be int). The inorder list should contain these 
objects, with operator <= overloaded so that the items with highest priority appear at the 
start of the list (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item.)
